# Wrath of Anima vs Steam library
This repo contains the source behind David Hughes' gaming blog.

The blog runs on a vanilla Jekyll install. Feel free to have a poke around to see how the site is built. Running locally can be done with just a regular `jekyll serve -w` call.

Content & code is copyrighted to David Hughes.


## Notes: 
*Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights* has no banner and a community hub instead of store page.
