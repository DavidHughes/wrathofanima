Well, it's been a busy few weeks, but I've finally managed to finish it. 31h of in game time provided a great value for the Â£8 pickup. I've been wanting to play another FF for a while and I was honestly expecting to be let down since VII & IX seemed to be much preferred by the FF community. However, once I buckled down and got playing, I realised that this edition still is put together to the same quality as the series' reputation has led me to expect.

If you are at all interested in the Final Fantasy series and/or general active-turn-based RPGs, this game should be on your to-play list.

Be warned however that you're in for a long ride, leading to me thinking that the plot &amp; character development was way too slow in disc one. Fortunately, character development starts to pick up fairly decently in the middle of disc two for most characters, though even then it's a little sketchy. Even having completed the game, I'm still not sure why Selphie is in Squall's party. Additionally, some of the characters' decision making are questionable at best. I got particularly annoyed at the end of disc one when Quistis decides that rather than prevent what looks to be a sure sign of some new age of Sorceress Edea's tyranny, she decides to <span class="spoiler">abandon her post in order to apologise to Rinoa for leaving her out, predictably leaving Quistis' party entrapped</span>.

Regardless of these pitfalls, Nobuo Uematsu pulled off an amazing job with the soundtrack as expected (I type while listening to [Liberi Fatali](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfd9krEsr-k&list=PL294020FE0E62D993)) & the world of FF8 provides truly memorable places such as the quiet Fisherman's Harbor, Squall's hometown of Balamb Garden, the labyrinthine Tomb of the Unknown King & of course future-town Esthar. 

There was also plenty of room for mechanically improving the party with the junction system, which allows you to absorb magic from your enemies and use it against them by improving your attributes. That and Triple Triad provide plenty of stuff for number crunchers!

In short, this is definitely a worthy pickup if you like (pseudo) turn-based RPGs. I'd hesitate to call it a brilliant introduction to the FF series, but hey, if you haven't played FF before, there's no reason not to now that 8 & 7 are available on Steam (7 being the fan favourite). I'm looking forward to replaying this probably next year as I'd like to revisit this game and try to explore some of the side content (I must find a Chocobo damnit, I had some Gysahl Greens going to waste at the end!).

Also, because I am bad at introducing screenshots, have one of the best quotes in the game:
