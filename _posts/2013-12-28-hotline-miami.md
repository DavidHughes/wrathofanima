This will be a short post since I didn't realise I was about 70% of the way through Hotline Miami when I took up this challenge. It's a pretty short game, taking me only around 7 hours, but dear lord it is fast paced and quite brutal.

You play the role of an unidentified man who is led by a series of cryptic phonecalls to essentially go on a murdering spree. Beyond that I'm honestly not too sure on the specifics, so apologies if you were interested in that.

As far as the actual gameplay, it's a top-down shoot/beat-em-up which is VERY fast paced. You and your enemies are equally fragile, you can use an arsenal of weapons, though it is often well-advised to stick with the quiet melee weapons for as long as possible to avoid drawing too much attention.

You can think of this game as a puzzle/stealth game that slowly turns into pure bloodlusty carnage in some of the later stages. It may frustrate you at points but it's overall a well crafted game with a great 80's inspired soundtrack & art style. If you aren't scared of a few brain-spilling brutal bloodfuelled rampages, give this game a shot!
