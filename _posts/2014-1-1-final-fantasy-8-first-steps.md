Happy new year, folks! I've decided to take my first steps into one of the larger games of my library - Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VIII. As a fan of the FF series, I have gotta say that I'm looking forward to exploring the universe. I'm only a few hours in and just seeing Shiva and Ifrit again was fantastic.
