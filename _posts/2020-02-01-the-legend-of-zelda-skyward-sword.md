It's been a while. Lockdown inevitably dragged me back to staring at my backlog (and playing a LOT of [Teamfight Tactics](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/)). Then I remembered I had this site which no one reads but figured I should document my progress anyway. At least I can give this bare-bones Jekyll site some attention and call it a coding side-project. This isn't a New Year's thing at all, in fact I will be pleasantly surprised if I keep this up past February, but let's see. 

Right, so, how do I do this writing thing again?

So, I did a Zelda. It was good. You play as Link, this time armed with the Goddess Sword. The main shtick of this game is that your swordplay is directly controlled by motion controls via the WiiMote & MotionPlus peripheral. This opens up lots of opportunity (and necessity!) for fine-grained combat, including slicing open a Deku Baba's head in the direction of it's mouth, or slaying multi-headed Staldras by attacking all three of their heads at once. As always for the series, the bosses are great 

On top of this there are lots of sidequests to do and bugs to catch, I did a fair few but I'm not too fussed about completing this one (not that I ever go for 100% typically, or even occasionally). Now that I write this though, I might have to see if I can help a particular friendly demon become human...

That said, it had problems. I'd argue the main issue was overambition as the Wii's motion controls, even with MotionPlus, simply didn't feel up to the job. Executing a stab should be as simple as thrusting the WiiMote towards the sensor bar, but this often ended up being misread as a vertical slash for some reason.

This is particularly annoying as stabbing seems to be a favourite for getting boss weak spots, particularly towards the end of the game. I feel like some thought could have gone into some form of leniency for encounters where a particular kind of attack is needed, especially if you have performed that attack in the fight earlier.

Overall, I think this entry gets a bad rap but I would argue that a re-release on the Switch could make the combat system a lot more tenable. I might even attempt the hard mode, an option I laughed at once I beat Demise.

I'm not sure what game I'll be going for next, I have just started Age of Calamity though that seems a tad lengthy for a backlog item to clear. I've also picked up [Mini Healer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/955740/Mini_Healer/) recently which seems fun, not sure how long it will take to clear. I'm hoping to decide soon and make a post about it.
