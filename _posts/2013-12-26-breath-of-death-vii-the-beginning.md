To kick us off is the retro, turn-based RPG, Breath of Death VII, or BreDth. The war of 20XX has destroyed life as we know it, with an undead civilisation uprising in its place. Thus we find our unlikely heroes, the skeletal warrior DEM, the ghost archeomage SARA, the techno-vampire LITA and the zombie barbarian formerly known as prince, ERIK.

As a fan of turn-based RPGs, I had to at least try this little indie out. After a few hours in, I've found that BreDth cuts a fine line between a cutesy throwback/satire game and a slightly ill-paced RPG with little filler.

This game has many great aspects such as the soundtrack. While small and a little repetitive in a few areas, the music does a great job and will definitely be something I'm looking to get my hands on. On top of that, BreDth has a good sense of humour and is VERY trope-aware:

> DEM: "... (Are you okay?)"
>
> SARA: "Yes, thanks for asking!"
>
> DEM and SARA get 10 relationship points!

As far as actual gameplay, I'm a fan of the style. There's a large emphasis on the Combo system - each time an enemy is hit, you get 1 combo point which benefits Combo Boost skills and are consumed by Combo Break skills. This leads to some tough tactical decisions, such as considering whether to Heal DEM (and thus Combo Break away your hard-earned points) or risk him dying while attempting to use the combo-finishing Deathblow.

LITA also gets a special mention from me as one of the more interesting characters that I've seen from a purely mechanical perspective. Each of her attacks in the early game actually counts as 2 hits, quickly ramping up your combo count and mitigating the cost of Heals. Later on in the game you find different attack-modifying weapons which change her role drastically, especially in the AOE department!

Sadly, the progression system is very minimal and leaves you stuck to regret choices made in the early stages of the game. Each time a character levels up, you get a choice between a distribution of bonus stats or a modified skill. This seems like a cool concept, but the lack of a respec functionality (or at least, I haven't found one yet?) is something that does concern me. I'm not feeling like I want to restart the game just for some different stats.

The only explicit plot is around boss battles and inside towns. This did nothing but frustrate me in some of the longer dungeons as I had many incidents of rage after getting slowly starved of MP while feeling no sense of progress. Fortunately you can just sit by checkpoints and farm battles with infinite HP/MP, but this just feels a little bit like cheating.

Overall, I'm a fan of the game and will probably try completing the game on hard at some point. Also, it feels good to get one off the list!
