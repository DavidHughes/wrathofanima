As someone who generally dislikes stealth based games but has heard wonders of the Metal Gear series, I am so glad that Platinum Games came along and put an action-heavy spin on the classic series.

In this edition of Metal Gear you play Raiden, a spine-consuming, hand-stealing cyborg who aims to disrupt the private military corp Desperado Enforcement's plans to invoke civil war in South Africa. Clocking in at a grand total of 9 hours, this is a fairly brief game but not without its challenges that Platinum Games, developers of Bayonetta and Vanquish, has led us to expect.

The combo system is fairly standard, with light and heavy mixups, launches & air juggles but what gives this game an extra push is the Raiden's Blade Mode. By activating Blade Mode, Raiden puts everyone else into slow motion, allowing him to finely slice and dice his foes however you choose to (angling with the right analog stick - make sure to take a note of that technique for later bosses!). Blade Mode allows you to disarm your foes very efficiently if you are not able to defeat them flat out in a timely manner, for example by taking out their legs. 

Despite the new gameplay choices, this is definitely still a Metal Gear game as evidenced by the explosions, gratuitous ham and abundance of massive robots - the first chapter has you fighting off a huge mech over three rounds! Obviously we've only just entered 2014, but I don't think it's too much of a stretch to argue that this is one of the top games of Q1 2014, so definitely give [Metal Gear another look on the Steam Store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/).

This is a great intro to the what Metal Gear is all about: generally crazy stuff happening with sci-fi galore - huge mechs, cyborgs with heat vision & supersonic sword slicing & fully sentient AIs in inhuman shells. And if you're already a fan of the series, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you as I only found this box.
